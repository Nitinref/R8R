Revolutionizing RAG Development
R8R is an enterprise-grade RAG Workflow-as-a-Service platform that transforms complex multi-LLM retrieval pipelines into simple API calls. Stop building RAG systems from scratch - deploy sophisticated retrieval workflows in minutes, not weeks.

🎯 What is R8R?
R8R (Rapid RAG Runtime) provides pre-built, optimized RAG workflows accessible via REST API. We handle the complexity of query rewriting, multiple retrieval strategies, and LLM orchestration so you can focus on building amazing AI applications.

The Problem We Solve
Building production RAG systems takes 4-8 weeks

Managing multiple LLMs and vector databases is complex

Query rewriting, hybrid search, and result synthesis require extensive tuning

Most teams reinvent the wheel for every project

Our Solution
API-first RAG workflows - Deploy in 5 minutes

Multi-LLM intelligence - Smart routing and fallbacks

Built-in query optimization - Automatic query rewriting

Multiple retrieval strategies - Vector, hybrid, multi-hop in parallel

Enterprise ready - Rate limiting, monitoring, security

⚡ Quick Start
1. Get Your API Key
bash
# Sign up at https://r8r.ai
# Get your free API key (1000 queries/month)
2. Make Your First Call
javascript
import R8R from 'r8r-client';

const client = new R8R('your-api-key');

const result = await client.query(
  "What are the latest treatments for type 2 diabetes?",
  {
    pipeline: 'advanced',
    sources: ['medical_journals', 'clinical_guidelines']
  }
);

console.log(result.answer);
3. Or Use REST API
bash
curl -X POST https://api.r8r.ai/v1/query \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "Explain quantum computing applications in healthcare",
    "pipeline": "research",
    "format": "detailed"
  }'
